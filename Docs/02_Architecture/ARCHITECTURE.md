## Responsibilities

### PlayerInputActions
Generated Unity Input System class. Contains Actions and bindings.

### PlayerInputHandler
Single access layer for player input.

### PlayerInventoryInput
Connects Inventory input to opening and closing the inventory.

### PlayerUIStateController
Switches between Game Mode and UI Mode.

### IInventory

```csharp
bool TryAddItem(InventoryItem inventoryItem);
bool TryRemoveItem(InventoryItem inventoryItem);
bool HasItem(ItemId itemId, int amount = 1);
IReadOnlyList<InventoryItem> GetItems();
```

### IGridInventory
Extends `IInventory` with an `InventoryGrid` and a change notification. `InventoryUI` depends on this contract so player and future container inventories can share the same grid presentation.

### PlayerInventory
Unity-facing inventory component for the player. It delegates storage rules to `GridInventory`.

### GridInventory
Reusable non-MonoBehaviour storage model shared by players and containers. It handles atomic stacking, adding, removing and counting. If the complete incoming amount cannot fit, it does not change the inventory.

### ContainerInventory
Unity component with Inspector-configured name, description, grid size and starting items. It should live on the same GameObject as that compartment's `Drawer`, `Door` or `ContainerInteractable`, keeping all per-compartment settings visible together in the Inspector. It owns a `GridInventory`, but is deliberately not an `IInteractable`; the physical interaction component calls `OpenFor` for the exact player.

### ContainerInteractable
Reusable world interaction for ordinary containers. Adding it automatically adds the required `ContainerInventory`, exposing metadata and grid size beside it. It optionally drives an `Animator` with `Open` and `Close` triggers and plays separate open/close clips through an assigned `AudioSource`. Inspector events remain an extension point for other effects or procedural animation. All presentation fields are optional.

### Drawer and Door
Physical interaction components. They animate the moving part and can optionally reference a `ContainerInventory`. Closing that container's UI raises `Closed`, which returns the connected mechanism to its closed state. Each physical storage compartment should normally own a separate `ContainerInventory`; sharing one is reserved for multiple access points that intentionally expose the same contents.

### InventoryTransferService
Commits an atomic transfer of a detached placement from a verified source grid to a validated destination grid. This local service is the seam that a future authoritative server command will replace.

### InventoryStackService
Owns the business rules for full and partial stacks. It validates the live source placement, amount range, target capacity and destination placement before committing `TrySplitWithinInventory`, `TrySplitAndTransfer`, `TryMergeStack` or `TryMergeDetachedStack`. The detached variant is used by ordinary drag and finalizes source ownership only after the destination accepts the entire stack. A failed operation leaves both inventories unchanged. The UI never writes `Amount` directly.

### InventoryDropService and WorldItemDropper
`InventoryDropService` commits the inventory transaction. A full-stack drop passes the same concrete `InventoryItem` instance to the world and only discards its detached placement after the spawn succeeds. A partial drop creates one new instance for the selected amount and reduces the source only after spawning succeeds. `WorldItemDropper` owns prefab instantiation and safe position calculation in front of the exact player; neither grid UI nor the item model searches for a player.

### InventoryGrid
Owns placements and validates bounds, overlap, movement and rotation. During drag it supports detach/attach as a transaction so the held item can rotate independently of its old grid position. It does not process input or render UI.

### InventoryPlacement
Connects one `InventoryItem` instance to a grid position and orientation.

### ItemData
ScriptableObject describing an item type, including its world prefab. The reference is type-safe (`WorldItem`), so an unrelated prefab cannot be assigned.

### InventoryItem
Concrete item instance or stack. Its guarded amount methods prevent a live stack from going below one or above `ItemData.MaxStack`.

### WorldItem
World representation of a concrete instance. A scene-authored item creates its instance during startup; a dropped item receives the already existing instance through `Initialize`, preserving amount and future instance data. Successful pickup moves that same instance into the inventory and destroys only the world representation.

### InventoryUI
Opens and closes inventory windows, subscribes to inventory changes and connects models to `InventoryGridUI`. Container mode displays the container grid on the left and player grid on the right. A shared topmost `DragLayer` keeps the temporary dragged visual above both panels without owning gameplay state. It coordinates cross-grid split destinations, world-drop boundaries and the single modal `StackSplitDialog`.

### InventoryGridUI
Displays cells and placements. Converts pointer positions to grid positions, but delegates placement validation to `InventoryGrid`. Its Inspector palette maps `ItemCategory` values to occupied-cell colors. During drag it asks the same `InventoryGrid.CanPlaceItem` rule used by drop and temporarily overrides the target cells with valid or invalid preview colors. On the first wheel step it restores the detached source unchanged and turns the held visual into a temporary split preview; model state changes only on a successful drop.

### InventoryItemUI
Displays one placement and reports pointer hover, drag/drop, wheel and Ctrl gestures to `InventoryGridUI`. Name and amount are presentation-only and hidden while dragging, except for the selected `xN` during split drag. Rotation input comes from `PlayerInputHandler`; `R` rotates the hovered placement and immediately refreshes the cell preview.

## Drop and split transactions

```text
full drag outside window
→ InventoryGridUI keeps source placement detached
→ InventoryDropService asks WorldItemDropper to spawn
→ spawned WorldItem receives the same InventoryItem
→ only then is the detached placement discarded

partial drag / dialog Apply
→ InventoryStackService revalidates source and destination
→ destination stack or WorldItem is created first
→ source amount is reduced second
→ Changed refreshes every affected grid
```

The area outside `InventoryRoot` is the deliberate world-drop zone. Empty space inside that root, including the gap between two grids, cancels and restores a full drag.

### PlayerInteractor
Finds `IInteractable` and calls `Interact(this)`.

### IInteractable

```csharp
void Interact(PlayerInteractor interactor);
string GetInteractionText();
```

## Container authoring rules

### One compartment, one storage model

Every independently stored drawer, door compartment, box or hidden cache owns a separate `ContainerInventory`. Sharing a reference is valid only when multiple access points intentionally expose the same contents.

Keep `ContainerInventory` on the same GameObject as its opening component:

```text
Static or Animator-driven container
├── ContainerInventory
└── ContainerInteractable

Procedural drawer
├── ContainerInventory
└── Drawer

Procedural door compartment
├── ContainerInventory
└── Door
```

### Collider ownership

The Collider used by `PlayerInteractor` must be on the interactable GameObject or below it in the hierarchy because interaction is resolved with `GetComponentInParent<IInteractable>()`. Avoid broad body colliders that intercept the ray before it reaches the physical mechanism.

### Optional presentation

`ContainerInteractable` supports three independent optional presentation paths:

- Animator triggers for `Open` and `Close`;
- `AudioSource.PlayOneShot` with separate open and close clips;
- `On Opened` and `On Closed` Inspector events for custom effects.

An ordinary container works with all presentation fields empty. `Drawer` and `Door` remain specialized for their current procedural movement.

For Animator-driven hinged containers, the Animator belongs to the interactable root and the clip animates a child path such as `Pivot`. The Pivot is positioned at the hinge and owns the mesh plus both physical and interaction colliders. A typical small opening clip records `localEulerAnglesRaw.y` from `0` to `10` degrees; controller transitions listen to the `Open` and `Close` triggers raised by `ContainerInteractable`.

Animator-driven sliding drawers use the same hierarchy and triggers, but animate the Pivot's local position rather than its rotation. The bedside `DrawerContainer` moves local X from `0` to `-0.3` over 0.25 seconds; placing both colliders below the Pivot keeps interaction and collision geometry synchronized with the visible drawer.

## Item model

```text
ItemData = immutable item-type definition
InventoryItem = mutable state of one instance or stack
WorldItem = world representation of that instance
Inventory = storage and rules for instances
```

## Multiplayer authority

The current Mirror integration uses the package's Canvas-based debug HUD instead of the legacy IMGUI `NetworkManagerHUD`. `NetworkStartupUIController` opens it before a network mode is selected, enters UI mode so the cursor is usable, and hides it after Host, Client or Server starts. `F1` toggles the debug menu. This is development tooling, not the final lobby UI.

Local-only:

- input;
- cursor;
- windows;
- local highlights;
- local camera behavior.

Server-authoritative:

- inventory contents;
- item transfers;
- pickup and drop;
- container state;
- doors;
- removed bolts;
- important world state.

Future flow:

```text
Client requests action
→ Server validates
→ Server changes state
→ Clients receive synchronized state
→ UI refreshes
```

## Modular character appearance

Character source meshes live under `Assets/FBXs/CharacterAppearance`, while the shared rig animations and `PlayerAnimator.controller` live under `Assets/Animations/Character`.

`CharacterAppearance` owns an ordered array of `CharacterSet` definitions. Each set references its character root and authored GameObjects for outfit, pants, shoes, hair, beard, eyebrows, head accessories and neck accessories.

An ID of `0` selects the first configured object in that category. Empty arrays are valid and mean that the category is not currently authored. The component never creates visual geometry.

Several appearance sets may intentionally share one character root when one imported hierarchy contains multiple fitted body variants. Root activation is therefore based on reference equality with the selected set's root, not solely on the set array index. All category variants are disabled first, then only the selected set's variants are enabled.

Runtime initialization happens in `Start`. `OnValidate` only clamps serialized IDs because calling `GameObject.SetActive` during Unity validation can trigger forbidden visibility messages. Inspector changes are applied by the custom editor after serialized-property validation has completed. Scene rebuilding and dirty-state operations are unavailable during Play Mode.

Authoring hierarchy:

```text
Character root
├── authored outfit variants
├── authored hair variants
├── authored beard variants
├── authored eyebrow variants
└── optional fitted pants / shoes / accessories
```

New wearable content must be fitted to the character rig in the source DCC/FBX workflow and explicitly assigned in `CharacterSet`. Bounds-based cubes, spheres or other generated stand-ins are not part of the architecture.

## Intentionally postponed

Future container transfer requests will contain the source inventory, destination inventory, item instance, requested position and rotation. The server must validate ownership and capacity before clients update presentation.

- network serialization;
- item factory;
- saving;
- durability;
- complex Player hierarchy;
- separate UI Action Maps.
